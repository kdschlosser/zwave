Pure Python ZWave Stack



***UPDATE***
<br/>
Well Silicon Labs and the ZWave Aliance have scrubbed this project. 
The claimed "public" specification is actually not public. It requires a 
membership to the Z-Wave Alliance which carries a cost of 1500 dollars a year. 
Sorry folks I am not goign to be spending that kind of money to access the 
specification so I can write software that would boost their business. 

I don't think they understand what a public specification means.  


Sorry Folks. Not gonna happen. I am but one person and having to do this by 
trial and error like every other time a Z-Wave stack has started to be developed 
and ultimatly ended up with it no longer being maintaned.... I don't want to 
spend the time and effort to end up the same way.
